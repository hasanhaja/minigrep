# Minigrep

This project is a part of the [progress of working through the rust book](https://github.com/hasanhaja/rust_book_workthrough "GitHub page of that project"). The project is almost as is in the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html "Chapter 12, The Book").

# Usage

Clone the repo and `cd` into it. Run the program using `cargo run <query> <filename>`. The file has to be in the root of the project directory. For example, since the repo contains the file `poem.txt`, a use case would be `cargo run to poem.txt`.

# Maintenance

I expect to experiment and add new features, for the purposes of learning, in the future. My main objective right now is to completely work through the book, so it might be a while before I get to do that.
